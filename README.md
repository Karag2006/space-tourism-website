-   Typescript (https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

First Frontend Mentor Project in a long time.
First time on my own working with next.js
Also First Time using Typescript on my own

Learned a few CSS Tricks, like assigning custom properties with a fallback value, used if the custom property is undefined

```css
.some-grid-container {
    column-gap: var(--container-gap, 2rem);
}
```

Also learned more about the use of useEffect and custom hooks, as well as using window and document inside react / next.js
